/**
 * Using a set of roads, broken roads and repair costs,
 *write an algorithm to calculate the minimum total cost to repair some of the roads so that
 *all the cities are once again accessible from each other.
 *
 *Input: The input consists of five arguments:
 *numTotalAvailableCities: an integer representing the total number of cities (eg: if N = 3, then cities are represented as 1,2,3).
 *numTotalAvailableRoads: an integer representing the total number of roads.
 *roadsAvailable: a list of integers where each element of the list consists of a pair representing
 *                the cities directly connected by a road.
 *numRoadsToBeRepaired: an integer representing the total number of roads that are unusable.
 *costRoadsToBeRepaired: a list of integers where each element of the list consists  of
 *                       triplet representing the pair of cities between which a road is currently
 *                       unusable and the cost of repairing that road, respectively
 *                       (e.g. [1,3,10] means to repair a road between cities 1 and 3 the cost would be 10).
 *
 *Output: Return an integer representing the minimum total cost to repair some roads so that all
 *the cities are accessible from each other.
